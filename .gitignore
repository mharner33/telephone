# Dependency management
# If you are using Go Modules, these are generally not needed as modules are handled
# by Go itself and dependencies are stored in the Go module cache outside the project.
# However, if using older dependency management tools like dep, you might need:
# vendor/

# IDE and editor files
.idea/
.vscode/
*.swp
*.bak

Thumbs.db

# Log files

# Environment variables and sensitive data (if applicable)
